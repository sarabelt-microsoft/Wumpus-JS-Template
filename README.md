# Wumpus-JS-Template
Setup basic Wumpus template for using Javascript, with files for using VSCode

## Getting started
To get started with this project first clone the repo.

## Tools
Then get the following tools:

**Visual Studio Code.** This is a great lightweight free code editors. It will do debugging, and GIT source control all built in.

**LiveServer vscode extension.** This is an extension that will fire up a lightweight web server on your local machine in order to run the web app from.

**ChromeDebugger vscode extension.** This is an extension that will allow you to easily debug all of your code.

## Development workflow
Once you have all of that setup, your workflow is something like this.

Write some code.
Make sure the LiveServer is running your local web server (there is a start/stop button in the bottom right of the status tray)
Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5500/ to run the app
Set breakpoints and run the ChromeDebugger to debug your code (Run->Start Debugging)
Rinse and repeat.
